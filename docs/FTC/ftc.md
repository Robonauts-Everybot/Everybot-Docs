### Disclaimer with the starter code:

The starter code has not been tested with other motors. We expect that the default power for the arm motor (which is 100%) may be too much for some configurations, we tested with NeveRest motor. We recommend starting with the arm power at 30% and slowly increasing it in increments of 10% until you are happy with it. Too much power and you risk sheering the pinion when the arm is against the PVC backstop.
