# CAD Overview

# What CAD software does Everybot team recommend?

CAD is an essential tool if you want design or modify robots effectively. If your team has a strong base of knowledge in Solidworks, Fusion 360 or another CAD ecosystem, it might be best to stick with what you know. For teams with split experience or no experience at all we highly recommend using Onshape.

## Why Onshape?

In many ways Onshape is CAD equivelent of Google Docs. It works exclusively in the browser, has cloud based storage and allows for multiple people to work on a project simultaneously. Onshape also has a ton of FRC support with custom feature scritps and a robot configurable part librarby. While other CAD software may be more established, be more widely used in industry and have a larger professional featureset, for the purposes of FRC, Onshape is more than enough.
