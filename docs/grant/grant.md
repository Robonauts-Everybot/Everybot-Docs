# The Robonauts Everybot Championship Grant powered by S&K Technologies

The Robonauts and Everybot crew strongly believe in the significant impact that attending the FIRST Championship event can have on a team’s aspirations and long-term sustainability. Many Everybot team members now consider their Championship experiences as core memories from their time in FIRST.

<br/>

The Robonauts are excited to announce that for the 2024 season S&K Technologies will be funding a grant covering FIRST Championship registration fees for a qualified team using an Everybot or “Everybot-inspired”* mechanism. This grant will be funded as an unrestricted grant through FIRST and deposited into the awarded teams account immediately upon selection.
