# Everybot Troubleshooting

## Everybot does not climb high enough
If the Everybot climber does not lift the robot far enough off the ground, check that the PVC slider can easily make its way up and down the climber box tube and that the motor and gearbox are running and engaging correctly. If the back of the robot makes it off the ground but the front hangs down and remains touching the ground, add more weight to the rear ballast.
## Everybot does not stay climbed

If the Everybot droops down on the chain and touches the floor within the period of time it would normally be hung up during endgame, a 1/2” ratcheting wrench can be added to the shaft to hold the robot up. A ratchet with a reversible pawl so that it can be flipped around to the other direction so it can more easily be reset is preferred, otherwise the ratchet would need to be removed after every climb. Be careful to not drive the climber too far as it will bind up the ratchet. Some kind of catchment like bolts in the bearing support on the climber may be helpful in keeping the ratchet in place.
## Everybot can not intake Notes into the launcher

If Notes are falling shallow off the intake chute for the launcher the height of the front of the launcher may need to be lowered down slightly. The bend in the end of the lower launcher plate can be increased up to the point that it causes the Note to drag on the top of the launcher chute, as too much of a bend will push the bottom plate upwards too far and cause shots to fall short. The [FIRST KitBot Guide](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/KitBot/KitBot%20Build%20Instructions.pdf) includes a section at the bottom with troubleshooting steps that suggests adjusting the front mounting point where the upright supports meet the chassis.
## Everybot can not make shots into the Speaker

Make sure the launcher wheel is spun up to full speed before firing. Check that the Notes are not scraping against the launcher top panel and adjust the bend in the end of the bottom panel so there is less of a hump midway through the launcher chute. If you have a slow motion camera on a team member’s cell phone, record a Note firing out of the launcher from above and see if it is brushing up against or bouncing off the roller claw or another portion of the robot. If the Notes are close to making it in, a slight adjustment of where the launcher mounts to the front of the chassis may also help. In our experience, both the KitBot and the Everybot shoot to the left rather than directly straight ahead.
## Can we use other motors/gearboxes/brackets/etcetera

In general, yes! Ideally, the climbing gearbox is somewhere between approximately 50:1 to 75:1, but other configurations may work, they will just need to be tested first. A variety of different manufacturer’s gearboxes can be used to run the climber. Any of the larger FRC–legal motors (CIM, NEO, Falcon, MiniCIM, etc) can drive the climber as well as 775-class motors as long as you are careful to not stall the motor and burn it out. The Everybot roller claw plates can accept mounting for a 775Sport, Max Planetary (and any motor with a 2 inch bolt circle), or VersaPlanetary.
