### README

<br/>

This is not a finalized and completed robot CAD model. Please do not treat it as such.

<br/>

None of these robot assemblies have been fully tested.

<br/>

There is no guarantee that a robot built from this CAD will work exactly as what is generated.

<br/>

Consider this a starting point; here are some considerations: 

<br/>

Robot Dimensions:
Our starting point Everybot Swerve CAD only works for 29”x29” chassis sizes. No other sizes are supported

<br/>

Deep Climb:
The height/length of the 92_Deep_Climb_Reaction_Bar, 92_Deep_Climb_Post and 92_Deep_Climb_Barb_Arm may need to be adjusted. This is best decided through testing. The provided length of the barb arm may be too long for a successful climb.
<br/>
We have not tested this climb on a swerve, you may need to add ballast for a successful climb. Refer to the Deep Climb Explanation in the Everybot Documents.
<br/>
Superstructure:
The location of the Cage Hard Stop may be incorrect for your robot. This may also need to be adjusted. The cage hard stop prevents the cage from being pulled in too far, which will cause the anchor to touch the superstructure. Testing will be required to finalize hardstop location
<br/>
Mounting to the chassis may not be optimized for your robot. Adjust as needed.
<br/>
Algae Arm:
The Algae intake has been relocated and the arm length shortened to avoid the swerve modules. However, it may still interfere slightly if there is no special attention given to lengths and tolerances.
<br/>
Belly Pan:
Each supported module generates a generic belly pan. Each belly pan is unique and may need to be modified to ensure it works for your specific robot.
<br/>
Electronics:
The provided location for the electronics is a suggestion. Please move components around to best accommodate your specific design.
<br/>
It is highly recommended to keep the Gyro in the center of your robot.
