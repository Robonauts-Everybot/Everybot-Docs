# Everybot and Swerve

The Everybot Initiative is constantly growing and evolving. We are always striving to make the best possible resources for the FIRST Community. To be able to do this we must identify gaps. Most recently we identified the need for a supplier agnostic Everybot for FTC. A gap in resources that have been identified in FRC: the ability to support a swerve drive robot. While many teams test swerve in the off season, that is not always a possibility for all teams. The Robonauts, and the Everybot crew, are making the first steps towards raising the floor by addressing this gap in resources.
<br/>
While attempting to support all FTC specific suppliers for the FTC Everybot, we learned just how difficult a task it was. But we also learned how to tackle it. This leads us to our first attempt at supporting an Everybot on a swerve chassis, regardless of which swerve module your team has.
<br/>
This resource is meant to be a starting point for teams wanting to take on the challenge of swerve. We hope that this resource can be used as a head start and a learning opportunity.
<br/>
We are proud to release the first revision of the EverySwerve Generator. Using the EverySwerve Generator, you can create a custom sized 2x1 extrusion chassis using any of the commonly and readily swerve modules from various FRC suppliers.
<br/>
Building onto the EverySwerve Generator, we have adapted the Everybot design to work with this tool. You can now select your desired swerve module and have an Everybot CAD model automatically created for you. This, we hope, will be the ultimate starting point for teams looking to delve into the world of swerve drives.
<br/>
The following post officially releases these tools to the world. This would not be possible without the amazing effort from Jaclyn. We are forever grateful for her support with this and the FTC Everybot Onshape models.
<br/>
Finally, before we actually release this tool, we have a couple of warnings.
<br/>
This is a new tool, and like all things in their infancy, there are bound to be issues. Here are a few issues we know about:
<ol>
<li>The Swerve Everybot Generator does not output a working robot. It is impossible to test all possible robots in all possible configurations.</li>
<li>The 2025 FRC Everybot in particular was not friendly to swerve module locations. Because of this, we have modified the design to work with the swerve modules. There may be a slight cost to performance.</li>
<li>The Deep Cage climb is heavily dependent on robot architecture and CoG location. A successful Deep Cage climb on a swerve Everybot must be tested and adjusted before going to competition.</li>
<li>The Algae intake has been relocated and the arm length shortened to avoid the swerve modules. However, it may still interfere slightly if there is no special attention given to lengths and tolerances.</li>
<li>The Swerve Everybot Generator does not support all swerve modules yet. We are working to support more in the future.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
We are releasing this tool in hopes to learn how to create an even better resource in the seasons to come. If you have any specific questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to speak up either here or on our Discord!
