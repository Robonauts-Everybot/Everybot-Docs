# Software Setup and Configuration

To set up your robot to properly run code, you will need to install several pieces of software ideally on a laptop that can be brought to competition. The laptop included in the Rookie Kit of Parts is sufficient for programming and driving the robot, but as your team expands you may want to invest in separate programming and driver station laptops so that your programming team can work on code while the drive team is driving the robot.

Required Materials
- Wired control system, ideally on robot drive base
- USB A to B cable (“printer” cable)
- Ethernet cable
- Robot battery
- Laptop(s)

You will need to have administrator access or permissions to install and change software on this laptop. A school-district managed laptop may be too restricted to properly use. The laptop in the Rookie Kit should be sufficient for programming and operating the robot.
