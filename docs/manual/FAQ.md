## How much does the Everybot weigh?

110 pounds with ballast.

## Do hits cause the Roller Claw to drop notes?

From our testing the note will not be dropped from robot to robot collisions.

## How does the Everybot stay climbed after the match?

We found that the Everybot climber did not backdrive when holding the robot with a CIM in brake mode and a 64:1 gearbox, no rachet mechanism required.

## What ratio is good for the climber gearbox?

We are comfortable recommending any ratio between 50:1 - 75:1 on a STOCK 110lb (without battery or bumpers) Everybot. A lower ratio may not be able to lift the robot or hold it up without a rachet wrench. A higher ratio will climb slower and could cause damage to the robot. If you are having trouble selecting a ratio we recommend using 64:1.

## Is the ballast required?

If you want to get Onstage (climb), then yes. Without the ballast the robot will tip towards the roller claw + launcher and the front bumper will touch the ground when the climber is fully retracted.

## Roller Claw?

Yes, Roller Claw.
