## Welcome to the Everybot documentation site!

<br/>

With this move we hope to accomplish the following:

<br/>

- Move away Google Doc as the public facing manual without heavily sacrificing collaboration, printability or ease of use
- Improve navigation of the manual
- Host resources relevant to Everybot and FRC teams in general
- Allow for the integration of those resources into the manual to give more context to specific actions
- Provide updates to teams on additions/changes to the manual and major events (critical out of stock components, etc.)

<br/>

Currently, we have electrical and chassis sections for the KitBot.

Plenty more content is on the way, look out for it in the coming weeks.
