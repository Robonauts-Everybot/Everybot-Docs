1/2" hex shaft is needed for both the climber and roller claw was left of the bill of materials due to an oversight on our parts. Links to purchase hex shaft can be found in the [bill of materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JyhVJVZ0inz81Wz3QoG46LAQDKUhNX0DPzLpNda1-z4/edit#gid=0) now. Please note that rounded 1/2" hex shaft also works, allowing the hex shaft to fit into  13.75mm bearings.
