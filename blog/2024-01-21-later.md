We have added an overview of the Everybot, bumpers, ballast and completed robot photos to the Everybot manual.

Other small changes have been added, the video for quick disconnects is now linked and Roller Claw now has an overview image.

The roller claws now have DXFs, printable 1:1 pdfs and a purchasing link in the Everybot resources tab. The AndyMark plates are not purchasable yet, we will alert you in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/n6CUjpmDV6) when they become available.
