As of 1/31 the [Spark Max motor controller](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-2158/) is currently out of stock from REV with a restock expected in [late February](https://www.revrobotics.com/stock/). If you are in need of motor controllers the best and most affordable replacement is the [Victor SPX](https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-9191.html) from VEXpro, which can only be used with brushed motor controllers. This will work with all recommended motors on the Everybot except the NEO on the climber.

To use the motor Victor SPX you will need Phoenix Tuner, here is the current link for newest [phoenix offline install](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Releases/releases/download/v24.1.0/Phoenix-Offline_v24.1.0.exe). If that does not properly install try this [link instead](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Releases/releases/download/v5.30.4.2/CTRE_Phoenix_Framework_v5.30.4.2.exe). These install come form CTRE's [github](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Releases/releases), for more documentation see [this](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/software/).
